All Speed and Consumption Figures are to be considered as  About
About means -0.5 knot for speed and +5 % for bunker consumption both always in vessels favour
Any speed claim to be set off against bunkers saved (maximum quantity of bunkers the ship was allowed to consume minus quantity she actually consumed).
Any bunkers overconsumption to be set off against time saved (maximum amount of time allowed for the ship to complete the voyage minus time actually used for the voyage).
Chrts can instruct
Master/vsl to sail as per above speed and consumption during the tc period. In the event Chrts instruct Master/vsl to switch from one speed/consumption to another or vice versa, during a ballast and/or laden leg, these instructions fm Chrtrs are to be given only fm way point to way pointany underperformance in speed and have to be practicable.
When the vessel is trading below CSO, the vessel has, for technical reasons, to run at full power for two hours each 48 hours.
Speed and consumption figures are given under good weather condition up to and including Beaufort Scale force 4 as to wind and max Douglas Sea State 3 (1.25m) .
Always basis clean, smooth bottom, no swell, without adverse currents and based on lsfo of max 380cst.
without adverse currents  not to be construed to mean that if there is adverse current, the speed/cons warranty does not apply. It means adverse currents and swells must be taken into account like wind force and sea state as described.
owners will not use  clean, smooth bottom  as reason/ excuse to disregard speed & consumption warranty.
Specification of LSFO / LSMGO:
Minimum quality specification of LSFO to be guaranteed by Charterers:
The fuel will be suitable for the use in vessel s engines and must be proven stable and homogenous, not to contain chemical waste and/or used marine- and/or automotive lubricants and according to international standard ISO 8217, 2010 latest amendment, low Sulphur grade of max 0.5 pct Sulphur RMG380cst.
Minimum quality specification of LSMGO to be guaranteed by Charterers:
